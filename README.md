# Maximum Covariance Analysis in Python
Maximum covariance analysis (MCA) tries to find the patterns in two data fields with maximum amount of cross-covariance.


In climate science, principal component analysis (PCA) or more commonly empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, is a method which maximises the covariance within a given data field. The theroy behind PCA can be extended in order to examine cross-covariance between two different variables (say SST and SLP) leading to **maximum covariance analysis** (MCA). 

Additionally, a linear transformation can be applied to lift the orthogonal constrain.
